## Usage

To use **qvmops** to disassemble a .qvm file, simply run:

    qvmops <file.qvm> [file.map]

If you provide a map filename, it will use it to load symbol information. If you do not provide a map filename, it will attempt to load one with the same name as the .qvm file, but with a .map extension (i.e. disassembling `qagame.qvm` will look for a `qagame.map` file for symbols). If no map file could be loaded, the file will be disassembled with less information.

## About

**qvmops** is a QVM file disassembler. QVM files are bytecode-compiled mod files for some Quake 3-based games. See [the QMM wiki](https://github.com/thecybermind/qmm2/wiki/QVM) for more information.

It will output the QVM file header information, the code segment with all instructions and hardcoded operands, and a hex-editor-style view of the data segment.

**qvmops** now supports loading symbols from a .map file (generated by q3asm at the same time as the .qvm file). If symbols are present, it will leave function symbol comments on OP_ENTER, OP_LEAVE, OP_CALL, OP_JUMP, and all the conditional branch instructions (OP_EQ-OP_GEF), and data symbol comments on OP_LOADx and OP_CONST instructions.

If symbols are not present, it will leave basic function symbol comments (using a naming scheme like "func150" or "trap2") on OP_ENTER, OP_LEAVE, OP_CALL, OP_JUMP, and all the conditional branch instructions (OP_EQ-OP_GEF).

See [qagame.qvm.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thecybermind/qvmops/refs/heads/master/qagame.qvm.txt) or [stvoy_qagame.qvm.txt](https://github.com/thecybermind/qvmops/raw/refs/heads/master/stvoy_qagame.qvm.txt) for example output.

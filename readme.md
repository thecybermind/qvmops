**qvmops** is a QVM file disassembler. QVM files are bytecode-compiled mod files for some Quake 3-based games. See [the QMM wiki](https://github.com/thecybermind/qmm2/wiki/QVM) for more information.

It will output the QVM file header information, the code segment with all instructions and hardcoded operands, and a hex-editor-style view of the data segment.

*qvmops* now supports loading symbols from a .map file (generated by q3asm at the same time as the .qvm file). If symbols are present, it will leave function symbol comments on OP_ENTER, OP_LEAVE, OP_CALL, OP_JUMP, and OP_EQ-OP_GEF (all the conditional branches) instructions, and data symbol comments on OP_LOADx and OP_CONST instructions.

If symbols are not present, it will leave basic function symbol comments (using a naming scheme like "funcINDEX" or "trapVALUE") on OP_ENTER, OP_LEAVE, OP_CALL, OP_JUMP, and OP_EQ-OP_GEF (all the conditional branches) instructions.
